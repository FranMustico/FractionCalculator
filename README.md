# FractionCalculator
The fraction calculator program is a tool designed to perform basic mathematical operations with fractions. The program is structured around a Fraction class, which contains functions to convert numbers to fractions and perform arithmetic operations on them.

The program allows the user to input two fractions and select the desired operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The Fraction class converts the user input to fractions and performs the corresponding operation to produce the expected answer.

The Fraction class contains functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. These functions simplify the fractions and ensure that the result is in its simplest form. 

When the user inputs the numbers, the Fraction class converts them to fractions and performs the desired operation. The program outputs the result as a fraction, mixed number, or decimal, depending on the user's preference.

The fraction calculator program is a useful tool for those who work with fractions on a regular basis. It simplifies the process of performing basic mathematical operations with fractions and ensures that the answer is accurate and in the correct form. The program is easy to use and can handle a wide range of fractions and operations, making it a valuable tool for students, teachers, and professionals alike.
